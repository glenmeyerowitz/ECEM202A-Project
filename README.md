# Using embedded sensors to recognize weather patterns that can degrade autonomous vehicle performance

Embedded sensors are becoming increasingly common. This ubiquity also increases their use in safety critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles or aerospace applications. If a sensor experiences a failure, or if the signal from the sensor degrades, it is necessary for the system to respond appropriately and adjust its behavior. Environmental impacts can often be the root cause of degredations or failures of embedded sensors. For instance, rain, wind, or snow can degrade the signal from a camera. Different classes of sensors have different strengths and weaknesses and thus will be susceptible to different types of failure modes and degredations.

This project will work to train an embedded system to respond to weather related degradations, such as rain, dust, and snow by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system will output a qualitative description of the environment based on the training of the sensor which will indicate what environment the sensor is experiencing.

Depending on the environment that the system is in, the system may need to adjust operating behavior. For instance, if a camera in an autonomous vehicle identifies that the vehicle is operating in rain, the system may decrease its maximal operating speed and increase the following distance from other vehicles. This is a safety measure to mitigate the impact of a degradation on system safety.
